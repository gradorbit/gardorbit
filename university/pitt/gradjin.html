            <div class="profile mar-top30">
                <p class="col-md-8">Shirley Jin is an experienced software developer, IT specialist, and tutor pursuing a master’s degree in Information Science at the University of Pittsburgh. Analytical and creative, she has two years of software development experience with particular expertise in Salesforce systems. Shirley learned about full-stack software development and demo skills during her internship, which prepared her even more for the workforce. She aspires to be a product manager, although she is flexible to undertake positions that would allow her to grow into a PM role.

                <p class="text-indent align-center">Demonstrating initiative, Shirley founded a Salesforce club at the University of Pittsburgh. Its current membership includes fifteen students. For the club, she promotes and elucidates Salesforce and Trailhead to students, organizes student events that introduce her peers to the community user group, and recruits students to be involved in Salesforce. During these duties, she continuously emphasizes what individuals can achieve within the Salesforce ecosystem. Moreover, she leads club sessions wherein she teaches students how to code in Salesforce as an admin or developer. Through the club, she has sharpened her communication, leadership, teaching, and entrepreneurial abilities.</p>

            <!-- </div> -->
            <p class="text-indent align-center">Before studying for her master’s, Shirley received a bachelor’s degree in accounting and management information systems with a minor in computer science from California State University, Chico. As a hard-working student, she landed on the Dean’s List for her exemplary grades. She also participated in a startup company, developing a solid database structure design for the hunting app and laying the groundwork for the programmers in India. </p>
            <p>Additionally, she volunteered for SIFE (now named Enactus), a non-profit organization that supports entrepreneurial students in their efforts to create and lead projects that give back to the community. She was the program manager for one semester and CFO for another. As the program manager, she oversaw the development of various projects, ensuring that she and her collaborators provided the best experience to the community. As CFO, she was in charge of budgets and seeking donations from local communities, which helped promote the organization while also bringing recognition to its students.</p>

        <!-- Work Experience -->
        <section class="content-section align-text-pad">
            <h3 class="mar-auto">Work Experience</h3>
            <p class="text-indent align-center">As a software developer at IGT, Shirley used multiple tools to enhance interfaces and streamline business processes while also conducting data analytics. She provided support to business clients in Salesforce, improving user access with Process Builder and Workflow rules. Through Informatica, she transferred data from SAP system to Salesforce platform. Moreover, she wrote ABAP code to fix bugs reported by SAP users. She embedded Tableau reports and dashboards in Salesforce platforms by using iFrames and JavaScripts. This approach allowed users to have a central place to view data and made the business process a lot smoother. On a broader scale, she managed projects for the company’s technical team, which she helped deliver one month early.</p>
            <p class="text-indent align-center">Interning at Intuitive Surgical, she improved her public speaking and demo skills and gained invaluable product management and IT experience by working on the full-stack development of a web application for internal employees. To eliminate repetitive tasks, she automated business processes for the finance team by using robotic process automation (RPA). She acted as a product manager for a web application’s new feature (PeopleFinder), which enables employees to pinpoint their location on an interactive map application called Campus. To create this tracking feature, she used Express.js, Node, MongoDB, and Mapbox. Additionally, she redesigned Campus's backend in order to make the app more scalable. For the front-end design, she conducted user testing to ensure the app's feasibility and user experience is top-grade. Employing her leadership skills, she guided the current Campus team while they finalized the PeopleFinder feature.</p>
            <p class="text-indent align-center">During her time at the California State University, Chico, Shirley worked as a tutor. She educated students who were struggling with accounting and statistics, helping them gain a better grasp on the subjects. With multiple-choice questions and hypothetical scenarios, she guided students to develop ideas on how to solve problems using alternative methods. Furthermore, as a teaching assistant, she led the lab sessions for Enterprise Tech Integration Class to help students solve SAP issues and imparted students with a better understanding of business processes in ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning) systems. She held office hours for the students as well. From all of these experiences, Shirley refined her coaching and communication skills.</p>

        <!-- Persona -->
        <section class="content-section align-center align-text-pad">
            <h3 class="mar-auto">Persona</h3>
            <p class="text-indent">As someone who sets high standards for herself, Shirley welcomes constructive criticism and is always motivated to solve problems to the best of her abilities. Analytical and curious, she tries to approach issues from multiple-perspectives, deferring to prior-learning while still open to expanding her knowledge. She understands that unforeseen circumstances often manifest when working on a project or task. Although sometimes frustrated by these hindrances, she has been reflecting on her perfectionist mindset and striving to develop a proper attitude toward all impediments that confront her.</p>
            <p class="text-indent">A fast-learner and problem-solver, Shirley loves to teach others. She views doing so as a way to pay-it-forward. Born and raised in China, she initially had much to learn about American culture when she moved to the U.S. nine years ago. Grateful for the vast knowledge and new experiences she has acquired, she now is confident in her understanding of both Chinese and American cultures. Possessing an invaluable dual-perspective, she wishes to bridge the gap in understanding between the two nations.</p>
