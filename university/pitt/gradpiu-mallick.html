            <h3 class="mar-auto">Work Experience</h3>
            <p class="text-indent align-center">Piu worked as a technology consultant at Hewlett Packard Enterprise in Bangalore, India. On behalf of a client (Healthways), she developed an integrated data-warehouse and managed the data and reporting of Healthways’ customers. In doing so, she executed the ETL process (Extract, Transform, Load) from Healthways’ source system to the enterprise data warehouse. </p>
            <p class="text-indent align-center">Her duties often involved cooperating with other technicians, thereby expanding her knowledge of various technical fields and strengthening her communication and collaboration skills. She interacted with business analysts and developers from other teams as well as the technical support team to deliver operational and financial reports, business analytics reports, and exception reports.</p>
            <p class="text-indent align-center">As an associate at Cognizant Technology Solutions, she supervised many automation processes for their client (Société Générale), helping to eliminate obsolete jobs. Moreover, her supervision led to the archival of old data and the creation of new batch/AutoSys jobs, which generated improved cohesive reports. Throughout her occupation, she resolved numerous critical production issues and mentored countless juniors who ultimately joined the team. She received a Guiding Star award from Cognizant Technology Solutions for being a great achiever, counselor, and mentor with the ability to build a cohesive team.</p>
            <p class="text-indent align-center">
                    Working as a programmer analyst, Piu facilitated a merger involving pension-fund data between Wells Fargo Advisors and Wachovia Securities. She also generated brokerage and retirement plan reports under five different areas (BRR Letter, 401 B, MADD, PIPS and Regulatory Reports).  Using both static and dynamic Actuate reporting tools, she played a crucial role in developing new reports and improving existing ones. A meticulous and proactive worker, she took initiative by fixing existing defects in an application while also enhancing the assigned areas. Based on her performance and constant efforts to ensure a zero-defect delivery, she was promoted as a team leader within a short time span.
