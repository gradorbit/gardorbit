    <section class="content-section align-text-pad">
        <p>After years of arduous coursework, many graduates leave college with crippling student debt but without a
            well-defined career path. Both grads and their families have high hopes that a rewarding job will follow
            promptly after graduation. When this desired outcome is not realized, disappointment and frustration set
            in.
        </p>
        <p>Celeste Sarne, a parent of a college grad, offered her thoughts on this predicament. <em><strong>“By the
                    time college
                    graduation arrives, you’re excited and ready for your child’s journey to begin,”</strong></em>
            she said. <em><strong>“Suddenly
                    though, your role is unclear. Do you help with their job search or let them navigate on their
                    own?”</strong></em>
        </p>
        <p>Over 40% of recent grads are underemployed according to a survey conducted by Gallup and Strada Education
            Network, meaning their first jobs out of college do not require degrees. Worse yet, these workers are
            five times more likely to remain underemployed after five years than those who initially took a job
            requiring a degree.
        </p>
        <p><em><strong>“Plus, today’s job market differs greatly from those of previous generations. Technology has
                    altered the application process, and people tend to switch jobs every few years. A generation
                    ago, workers stayed at the same job for decades. Because of these changes, parents may offer
                    outdated career advice and fail to empathize with the younger generation’s career troubles.”
                </strong></em></p>

        <p>
            During the progression from high school to college, parents and guidance counsellors nudge students into
            a stable higher educational orbit. In contrast, the college graduate typically confronts the transition
            from college to workplace alone. Campus career centers exist, but they often have inadequate resources,
            offering generalized career-related support rather than individualized help for each student’s unique
            career path.
        </p>
        <p>The same grads, who just a few years earlier depended on their parents to guide them through the
            financial aid and college application processes, now refuse to reach out to them for career advice
            because they wish to assert their independence as young adults.
        </p>
        <p>Spencer Bonfiglio, a graduate with an English degree from Seton Hill University, shared his thoughts on
            why grads are reluctant to ask their parents for career help. <em><strong>“After living away from home
                    for years,
                    grads believe that relying on mom and dad would be a step backward,”</strong></em> he said.
        </p>
        <p>Herein lies the challenge: With minimal support from universities and parents, how do qualified grads
            find proper employment?
        </p>
        <p>Personalized mentoring, confident storytelling that highlights a grad’s overall profile, and networking
            are vital avenues to career success. Grad Orbit, an initiative from Grad Orbit, LLC that connects
            graduates with mentors, offers a comprehensive solution:

            <ul>
                <li>We create individualized grad profiles (<strong class="logo-acronym">GO</strong>profiles) that

                    experience, and persona. These profiles establish and promote grads’ personal brands.
                </li>
                <li>
                    We craft an authentic narrative of each grad using information from the profiles and chat logs
                    between mentors and mentees. These narratives delve into grads’ unique personalities, revealing
                    their strengths, principles, interests, and backgrounds. We believe that this form of storytelling
                    heightens grads’ confidence by elucidating their distinct value to the job market.
                </li>
                <li>We match grads with suitable jobs. To achieve this aim, mentors and grads explore career
                    opportunities that align with the latter’s unique values and skill sets. When appropriate, mentors
                    will direct grads toward internships and co-op programs as stepping stones to first jobs. In

        <p>Aruna Nadesan, founder of Grad Orbit, expounded on the initiative’s role. <em><strong>
                    “The purpose is to mentor grads into a stable career orbit,” she said. “While our focal point is
                    the grad, our goal is for all
                    parties to benefit from this collaborative effort: grads, mentors, and hiring companies. We want
                    grads
                    to be proactive, networked, and confidently prepared when looking for their first job. During
                    this
                    critical phase of their professional career, we expect that grads experience a memorable journey
                    and join
                    an organization that is a good match. Through our initiative, employers will have access to
                    grads
                    who are more professionally savvy, empathetic, and industry aware than their peers.”
                </strong></em>

        <p>A member of this initiative, Gurveen Saluja is a graduate student pursuing a master’s degree in
            mechanical engineering at SUNY Stony Brook. She spoke about the lack of mentorship in the workplace. “I
            feel that there are a lot of influencers, but not a lot of mentors,” she said.

            </div>
        </p>
        <p><em><strong>“Many companies provide assistance,”</strong></em> Gurveen added, <em><strong>“but they all
                    have one
                    thing in common: you are
                    assigned an advisor; you do not get to pick one. Since it is my career decision, I should be
                    able to
                    pick my mentor, someone I can bond with.”</strong></em> </p>
        <p>Aware of this issue, Grad Orbit allows graduates to choose their mentors and swap one for another if the
            relationship is not a good match.</p>

        <p>Fiza Shaukat, an aspiring mentor at the initiative, expressed her passion for supporting grads.
            <em><strong>“Connecting with students to help them define their career path provides me with a real
                    sense of
                    achievement,”</strong></em> she said.
        </p>
        <p>Through the initiative, grads will share their thoughts and emotions, enabling mentors to empathize and
            bond with them. This rapport ensures that mentors tailor their advice to match their grads’
            personalities, values, and ambitions. By showing them how to understand and navigate the job market,
            mentors will empower grads to make their own career choices.</p>
        <p>“The industry experience of our mentors can range from less than a year to many decades,” Aruna Nadesan
            said. “This platform will offer new professionals the opportunity to mentor while the experience is
            fresh in their mind, a prospect that they typically do not get as recent hires. Unlike many companies,
            Grad Orbit values the insights of new employees because they have immediate knowledge of what it takes
            to secure a quality job.”

        <p>Venkat Kowkuntla, a grad student pursuing a master’s degree in information systems management at Carnegie

        <p>To be qualified for the program, grads must meet a GPA requirement and display a commitment to integrity,

            to become mentors themselves after completing the program. Mentors at Grad Orbit (<strong

            Carnegie Mellon, admires the passion, expertise, and empathy of the mentors at Grad Orbit.</p>
