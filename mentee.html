        <h2 class="align-center margin-auto">Introducing Gurveen profile</h2>
        <p class="mar-top30 text-indent">Gurveen Saluja is a graduate student pursuing a master’s degree in mechanical
            engineering at SUNY Stony Brook University, New York. She has a 3.75 GPA and specializes in design and
            manufacturing. Her thesis, which she expects to complete by August, is on kinematics (i.e., motion) of the
            human arm. Gurveen aspires to perceive her career in product design and development and human-centered
            design.

    <section class="content-section align-text-pad">
        <h2 class="align-center margin-auto">Academic Achievements</h2>
        <p class="mar-top30 text-indent">In 2017, she received her B.E. in mechanical engineering at the Vasavi College
            of Engineering in Hyderabad, India. While studying at the college, she participated in campus events
            organized by the National Entrepreneurship Network (NEN), a community focused on developing entrepreneurial
            skills in undergraduate students. She and her team received an award for their work.
        </p>
        <p class="mar-top30 text-indent">For an academic project at Vasavi, she collaborated with three classmates to
            design and analyze a leaf
            spring, a component in heavyweight vehicles. In particular, she compared a stainless-steel leaf spring with
            one built of composite materials. Her team demonstrated significant weight reduction when swapping steel for
            a composite structure. They used Siemens NX 10 to design the composite spring and Ansys Workbench for
            analysis.</p>
        <p class="mar-top30 text-indent">As a graduate student, Gurveen designed increasingly complex products. Under
            the guidance of Dr. Anurag Purwar (a Stony Brook professor), she and her peers developed parts for SnappyXO,
            a modular robotics kit. They used Autodesk Inventor to digitally design the parts and a laser cutter to
            manufacture them with Delrin material. She and her team performed all of the stages involved in product
            development: conceptualizing, designing, manufacturing, testing, and collecting feedback.</p>

    <!-- Work Experience -->
    <section class="content-section align-text-pad">
        <h3 class="align-center margin-auto">Work Experience</h3>
        <p class="mar-top30 text-indent">In 2013, she co-founded Ashkom Collections, an online retail store that sells
            fashion accessories such as handbags, watches, and sunglasses. Through this work, she has developed skills
            in sales, market research, public relations, inventory management, and vendor management.

    <!-- Work Experience -->
    <section class="content-section align-text-pad">
        <h3 class="align-center margin-auto">Work Experience</h3>
        <p class="mar-top30 text-indent">This section highlights a grad’s most impressive work experiences. The
            narrative expounds on a grad’s key roles and duties at jobs, internships, and/or co-op programs. Moreover,
            these passages emphasize the professional skills that a grad applied and developed while working. This
            section also mentions a grad’s most successful work projects.
        </p>
        <p class="mar-top30 text-indent">During her time at SUNY Stony Brook, she has held multiple occupational
            positions within the university. From 2017 to 2018, she worked as an office assistant. More recently, she
            has been a graduate teaching assistant in the engineering department, performing clerical and instructional
            duties for courses titled Freshman Design Innovation and Design of Machine Elements.</p>

    <!-- Persona -->
    <section class="content-section align-text-pad">
        <h3 class="align-center margin-auto">Persona</h3>
        <p class="mar-top30 text-indent">As a people-oriented individual, Gurveen prefers to work in either a team
            environment or a customer-facing role. However, she is open to growing into these positions. Her sales
            experience at Ashkom Collections has shaped her into a customer-driven person who understands clients and is
            receptive to their wants and needs. Furthermore, by teaching college students, she has recognized her innate
            desire to help others succeed.
        </p>
        <p class="mar-top30 text-indent">Unafraid to offer her thoughts and opinions, she wants to work for a company
            that encourages new ideas and is open to change. When necessary, she likes to function as a change catalyst.
            Moreover, she believes that learning never stops. By living in both India and the United States, she has
            developed full professional proficiency in Hindi and English. She also has professional working proficiency
            in Punjabi and limited working proficiency in Telugu.</p>
