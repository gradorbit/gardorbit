            <div class="profile mar-top30">
                <p class="col-md-8">Ashwin Mendhi holds a master’s degree in business administration and management from Case Western Reserve University. He has seven years of business consulting experience in healthcare and technology, having managed multimillion-dollar projects across globally-distributed teams. Possessing cross-functional leadership and design-thinking expertise, he brings innovative products and solutions to the marketplace. He aspires to hold team-leadership and client-facing roles in product management, business analysis, and solution design.

            <h3 class="mar-auto">Academic Achievements</h3>
            <!-- <div class="profile mar-top30 align-base"> -->
                <!-- <p class="col-md-4 mar-auto">
                    <img src="../img/team/gs_ulogo.png" />
                </p> -->
                <p class="text-indent align-center">Adept at many programming languages, Ashwin draws on his technical experience to identify problems and applies his creativity to solve them. As a graduate research assistant, he co-developed a web app in Python 3 using Flask and SQLAlchemy libraries. The app, owned by the university’s Poverty Center, enables government and private institutions to access a database with over 300 data points on Cuyahoga county's land use, poverty, crime, and other key info. Institutions use these data points for analysis and city development.
                </p>

            <!-- </div> -->
            <p class="text-indent align-center">Ashwin also worked on a Cleveland Institute of Music (CIM) project. He and his team used design thinking and lean product management concepts to create a sustainable business model for CIM's distance learning program. They defined and validated multiple hypotheses about the target market and customers. To land on a final business model, they incorporated design thinking tools such as journey mapping, ethnographic interviews, and rapid prototyping.</p>

        <!-- Work Experience -->
        <section class="content-section align-text-pad">
            <h3 class="mar-auto">Work Experience</h3>
            <p class="text-indent align-center">During his time at HM Health Solutions, Ashwin led solution development for projects worth up to $2.5 million. He worked closely with clients to understand their vision and needs as health plan payers while also accounting for associated business benefits and risks. Moreover, using digital tools such as Salesforce, Microsoft Project, Clarity, and SharePoint, he managed timelines, resources, and budgets to ensure successful project delivery.
            </p>
            <p class="text-indent align-center">With an eye toward innovation, Ashwin has years of experience in business design. Alongside clients and development teams, he has participated in JAD sessions to create technical requirements and design solutions that meet business needs. At University Hospitals, he organized physical and virtual ideation sessions on design-thinking for complex projects. These sessions identified solutions to user pain points and prioritized ideas on prototyping and user testing. Outside these sessions, he created journey maps that included lowest level details about customer engagement, which exposed areas of pain and opportunity.
            </p>
            <p class="text-indent align-center">Throughout many projects, Ashwin has sharpened his leadership and communication skills. He once coached a 65-member team in Lean, Six Sigma, and other process improvement techniques. He also worked for a company undergoing IT transformation. They were phasing out legacy systems and implementing SAP at their offices around the globe. Ashwin led the effort to elicit requirements for twenty applications implemented in twelve countries across the Americas. Capturing accurate business requirements depends on effective communication, but stakeholders from some countries were not fluent in English. To overcome this linguistic barrier, he created low-fidelity prototypes that reduced the dependency on language and brought clarity through pictures. Thus, he and his team eliminated the need to hire a translator and were able to gather requirements without delaying the project. </p>

            <h3 class="mar-auto">Persona</h3>
            <p class="text-indent">Ashwin views himself as a life-long learner. In addition to being skilled at multiple programming languages, he is fluent in English, Hindi, and Marathi. He also values sharpening his artistic ability. During his free time, he enjoys painting with watercolors and sketching. He would love to create a cartoon character and comic strip. These creative endeavors bolster his proficiency in visual design thinking, which he has employed in various occupational roles.
            </p>
            <p class="text-indent">Moreover, his creativity has given him opportunities to teach others, thereby strengthening his communication and leadership skills. He taught drawing and painting to primary school students and at a pre-school for underprivileged kids.</p>
            <p class="text-indent">His love for learning contributes to his self-perception as an explorer. Fascinated with outer space, he frequently studies the field of astronomy by reading pertinent books and listening to podcasts on the subject. On the practical side, he regularly attends events organized by local astronomy clubs, during which he and others observe the night sky for constellations, planets, and other celestial bodies.</p>
